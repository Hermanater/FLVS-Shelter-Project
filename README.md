# FLVS Shelter
FLVS, or Faithful Lives Veterinary Shelter, is a fictional establishment that this project was created for. It tracks housed animals, their cages, all cages and their respective numbers and target weight values, as well as a rudimentary budget controller, which doesn't allow the adding of animals if their weight cost would put revenue in the negatives. It also tracks denials of animals and their causes, as well as removals, also with their causes.

Cloning this repository in VS and starting the project will prompt you to enter a security code, which is 57092. After this I encourage you to explore the project (however small) and give any and all feedback! This can be directed to >> cooperherman09@hotmail.com
